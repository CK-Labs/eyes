# Wandering eyes (an MITxPRO Eye Exercise)
## Project Title: ``Wandering Eyes``
## Description: 
``Wandering eyes`` is an interactive project is an assignment created by the MIT x PRO Full Stack MERN course. 
This exercise illustrates how events happen on the DOM to bind code to user actions. Using a combination of HTML, Javascript and CSS, the "eye" element built on the page follows the movement of the user's mouse. 

## How to Run
To get started running this project on your machine, you can download the repository as a directory onto your local drive. Run the index.html file on any source code editors (ie. VS Code) and preview your edits on HTML source viewer (ie. Google Chrome browser).

This project includes 4 files:
•	<b>index.html</b> which displays the html site where you can see the code demo-ed
•	<b>eyes.js</b> which includes the javascript programmed to run the eyes elements to follow the mouse
•	<b>styles.css</b> which includes the styling of each object (including the background, eye socket, eye ball and pupil)
•	<b>pupils.js</b> a work-in-progress javascript for future improvements

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
Future improvements for this project include:
•	Customize elements further for a better narrative, such as:
  -Format the background - ie. add rotating stripes to resemble a Cheshire cat
  -Replace the moving mouse with an animated graphics - ie. cat teaser wand or a fly
  -Add obstacles to avoid - ie. a tongue that captures the user's mouse if it is not moved too long
  -Countdown to warn the user of their 'idleness'
•	Create a functioning element called pupil that moves faster than the eyeballs to follow the position of the mouse
