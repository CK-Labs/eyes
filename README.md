# Wandering eyes (an MITxPRO Eye Exercise)

``Wandering eyes`` is an interactive project is an assignment created by the MIT x PRO Full Stack MERN course. 
This exercise illustrates how events happen on the DOM to bind code to user actions. Using a combination of HTML, Javascript and CSS, I used the starter code from MIT x PRO to build the "eye" element on the page which follows the movement of the user's mouse. 

## How to Run
This project includes 3 files:
1. eyes.js
2. index.html
3. style.css

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
Future improvements for this project include:
-furthering the narrative by customizing elements to display the mouse as a 'fly'
-creating a functioning element called pupil to better indicate the position of the mouse
